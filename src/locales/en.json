    "intro": "This website displays the information collected by a tool that checks a series of vaccination locations every five minutes for available appointments. It was made to try to help people find appointments in one central place, rather than the many different websites and formats spread all over the internet. It is not associated with or endorsed by any government or company, and the owner makes no money from it; it's entirely something he made in his spare time, which he's got a lot of these days.",
    "how.html": "Every five minutes a tool runs through a list of saved locations and tries to gather any information about available vaccine appointments that they list on their websites through a few different methods (scraping, API requests, etc). This site just organizes and shows the results. Sometimes the sites are down or incomplete, and many don't list any availability or hide it behind personal logins, so this page won't always be an exhaustive list, but hopefully it's a pretty extensive one. It's entirely open source code, so if you're interested you can <a href=\"https://github.com/pettazz/findvax-site\" target=\"_blank\">check out the GitHub repository</a>. And if you're so inclined, contributions (bug reports, pull-requests, text language translations, anything at all) are hugely welcome and appreciated!

    "why.html": "Seeing the frustration of people trying to deal with the complicated mix and match of websites and services that made up the different vaccination sites all over the country, it seemed pretty obvious that we could do a better job of helping people find ways to get shots in their arms faster. So a computer nerd near Boston decided to apply his skills to something useful for once and made this thing. Plus he actually enjoys doing this kind of stuff. Can you believe that? What a dork."
